Your reference number shall be sent to you at least 30 days before your arrival.
Diplomatic missions are in Frankfurt and in Berlin (in Germany) or in your country of residence.
After
Make sure you get a student visa (DH), not a tourist one (DL) by making sure that the officer stamps you the
correct visa type “DH” which is issued for study purpose. (Check at the Embassy/Diplomatic Unit where the
visa is issued).
Further guidelines and highlights regarding visa receipt can be sent out to you once your visa reference number
has been issued.
Maybe you should know before arrival:

the city. Free Wi-Fi is widely available in cafes, restaurants, hotels, and many public

Translation apps are very helpful, not everyone will understand English. Google Translate is the most popular.
In order to reach the VGU Campus in Binh Duong (Not Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon), please refer to the Transportation
section. We recommend using Grab or Xanh SM, go outside the international terminal and over the crosswalk, and try to
find your driver there. You may get scammed if you use an external taxi service that wasn’t recommended by us.

text your Buddy to come pick you up, and show you around.Meet us at the International Office at Room 218, 2nd Floor, Admin Building, Binh Duong campus to verify documents, submit
pictures of your visa stamp and entry stamp, and get your student ID card, which is a must during your time at the campus.
If you study at Ho Chi Minh Campus, the student card can be sent to the program assistant for your collection.
Check in at the Dorm at VGU if you registered to stay at the Dorm, or find accommodation if you will live outside the campus.
Important: According to the current Vietnam immigration Law, a foreigner has to register at the local police station after arrival in
Vietnam. If you live at VGU dorm, this will be taken care by VGU Dormitory Management Board, please kindly present your original
passport to the dorm officer upon your arrival at the check-in process step. In case you live in a rented accommodation, please ask your
landlord to take care of this issue.
